1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,389
hey Vsauce Michael here Gregory W Nimitz

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,389



3
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:11,630
registered some land containing 492

4
00:00:08,379 --> 00:00:11,630



5
00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:17,400
quintillion dollars worth of platinum

6
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:17,400



7
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:22,560
the land was right here well over here

8
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:22,560



9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:25,050
an asteroid named 433 eros not a single

10
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,050



11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,990
sovereign nation on earth recognizes

12
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,990



13
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,990
human claims to extraterrestrial real

14
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,990



15
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:34,230
estate but he did it anyway and then

16
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,230



17
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,899
less than a year later NASA landed a

18
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,899



19
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:39,239
probe on the asteroid they called it the

20
00:00:36,889 --> 00:00:39,239



21
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:43,200
first asteroid we had ever landed a

22
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:43,200



23
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:47,129
probe on Nimitz called it parking space

24
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:47,129



25
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,260
number 29 and promptly sent NASA a $20

26
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:48,260



27
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:51,840
parking ticket

28
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,840



29
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:53,969
but so far NASA and the US Attorney

30
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,969



31
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,340
General have dismissed the fine saying

32
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:56,340



33
00:00:53,969 --> 00:01:02,070
that his claim to own the asteroid is

34
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:02,070



35
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:04,110
without legal merit but why plenty of

36
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,110



37
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:07,110
organizations exist that will gladly

38
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,110



39
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:10,049
take your money in return for land on

40
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,049



41
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,990
the moon Venus Mars and if you had

42
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:12,990



43
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:15,600
enough money to go to the moon nothing

44
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,600



45
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,340
is legally stopping you from moving

46
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,340



47
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,320
there building a house with a

48
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,320



49
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,460
significant other having some kids and

50
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,460



51
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:25,770
turning your moon house into a moon home

52
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,770



53
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:30,750
it wouldn't be trespassing or squatting

54
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,750



55
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:33,360
or stealing the 1979 moon treaty says

56
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,360



57
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,900
that no one can own any part of outer

58
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,900



59
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:41,130
space ever but only 11 states have

60
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:41,130



61
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:44,340
signed it however 129 nations have

62
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,340



63
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:47,430
signed and/or ratified the 1967 Outer

64
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:47,430



65
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:50,939
Space Treaty which says that outer space

66
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,939



67
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:53,579
is not subject to national appropriation

68
00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:53,579



69
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:57,030
it says nothing about a private

70
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:57,030



71
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:59,700
individual or a company owning part of

72
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,700



73
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,490
outer space but without the recognition

74
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:02,490



75
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,009
and support of at least one sovereign

76
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,009



77
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:08,789
nation what does ownership

78
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:08,789



79
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:11,760
really mean I mean I can claim any

80
00:02:08,779 --> 00:02:11,760



81
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:15,269
want I can claim to own Prospect Park in

82
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,269



83
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,670
Brooklyn but just saying that I do or

84
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:17,670



85
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:20,040
even moving there and living in Prospect

86
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,040



87
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:22,140
Park wouldn't entitle me to the rights

88
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,140



89
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,290
that usually go along with ownership

90
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:25,290



91
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:28,680
unless someone with a bunch of power

92
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,680



93
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,989
agreed that I owned it and could enforce

94
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,989



95
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,859
that ownership and keep others from

96
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:33,859



97
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:36,959
claiming to also own it in the past

98
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:36,959



99
00:02:33,859 --> 00:02:39,750
explorers had few qualms about claiming

100
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:39,750



101
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,870
to own land even if other humans were

102
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,870



103
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:46,650
already there because they had power on

104
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,650



105
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:48,290
their side mainly plenty of Guns Germs

106
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,290



107
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,359
and Steel

108
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,359



109
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:55,799
to paraphrase con artists Canada Bill

110
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:55,799



111
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:59,370
Jones you know what beats for aces a gun

112
00:02:55,789 --> 00:02:59,370



113
00:02:55,799 --> 00:03:01,590
or as la blob pointed out McDonald's

114
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,590



115
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:05,639
actually does serve breakfast after

116
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:05,639



117
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:07,739
10:30 if you have a gun if you claimed

118
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:07,739



119
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:10,200
some land on the moon as your own and

120
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,200



121
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:12,810
moved in would you also have to hire

122
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,810



123
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,659
your own lunar police and cislunar

124
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,659



125
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:19,819
military to defend it and to keep others

126
00:03:15,649 --> 00:03:19,819



127
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:22,889
from challenging your claim pretty much

128
00:03:19,809 --> 00:03:22,889



129
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:25,650
that's kind of the problem currently it

130
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,650



131
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:28,829
is risky for individuals or corporations

132
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,829



133
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,889
to claim and use extraterrestrial

134
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:30,889



135
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:34,470
territory because the Outer Space Treaty

136
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,470



137
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:39,870
says that outer space is the common

138
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:39,870



139
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:45,000
heritage of mankind it belongs to all of

140
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:45,000



141
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:46,739
us and only to all of us many

142
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,739



143
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,840
interpretations of the Outer Space

144
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:48,840



145
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:52,139
Treaty predict that powerful things like

146
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:52,139



147
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,859
nations would be reluctant to come to

148
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:52,859



149
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:54,870
your defense

150
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:54,870



151
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:56,939
should someone else want to move in or

152
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,939



153
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,480
cause trouble or dispute your

154
00:03:56,929 --> 00:03:59,480



155
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:02,300
extraterrestrial claim

156
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:02,300



157
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,549
maybe you could get a sovereign nation

158
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,549



159
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:07,370
to weigh in on your behalf by declaring

160
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:07,370



161
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:09,530
universal jurisdiction but that would

162
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,530



163
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:11,690
need to be for an incredibly terrible

164
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,690



165
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:14,349
heinous crime a crime against all of

166
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,349



167
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:17,750
humanity not just a dispute over a few

168
00:04:14,339 --> 00:04:17,750



169
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:19,760
space rocks catherine dole dureena from

170
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,760



171
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:22,040
the institute of air and space law at

172
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,040



173
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,199
mcgill university suggests that

174
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:24,199



175
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:27,710
considering outer space the common

176
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:27,710



177
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:30,680
heritage of mankind has slowed space

178
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,680



179
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:33,350
exploration you see the outer space

180
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,350



181
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,510
treaty was based on the Antarctic Treaty

182
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,510



183
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:37,760
which says that the entire continent

184
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,760



185
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:41,270
shall never become the scene or object

186
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,270



187
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:43,699
of international discord discord is not

188
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,699



189
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:46,520
a good thing but without an incentive to

190
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:46,520



191
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:49,820
profit from it not much has happened

192
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,820



193
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:52,940
there as opposed to the Arctic where a

194
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:52,940



195
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:56,060
resource boom is currently underway if

196
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,060



197
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:58,310
people felt safer appropriating and

198
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,310



199
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,000
taking advantage of space of celestial

200
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,000



201
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,220
bodies

202
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,220



203
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,430
if technological development was more

204
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,430



205
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:07,340
incentivized would we already have

206
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,340



207
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:12,860
orbiting tourist attractions and lunar

208
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:12,860



209
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:16,580
hotels maybe but here is what you can

210
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:16,580



211
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:20,330
currently own in outer space stuff you

212
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:20,330



213
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:23,180
put there and to a certain extent orbits

214
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,180



215
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:25,760
the Outer Space Treaty says that the

216
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,760



217
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:28,580
stuff we left on the moon anything put

218
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,580



219
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:31,910
into space remains property of the

220
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,910



221
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:34,400
original owner forever orbits around

222
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,400



223
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:36,849
Earth are temporarily granted by the

224
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,849



225
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,410
International Telecommunication Union a

226
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:39,410



227
00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:42,470
UN agency but they don't work like

228
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,470



229
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:45,169
typical real estate on earth when a

230
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,169



231
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:47,630
group of equatorial nations attempted to

232
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:47,630



233
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:49,250
claim orbits above their land boundaries

234
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,250



235
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:53,570
without planning on putting satellites

236
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,570



237
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:56,090
there their claim was largely ignored so

238
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,090



239
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:58,639
you not only need to ask the UN for an

240
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,639



241
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:01,789
orbit and get permission you also need

242
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:01,789



243
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,740
to use it and fill it it's a little

244
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,740



245
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:06,180
disappointing that we don't know how

246
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,180



247
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:09,240
lunar real-estate work

248
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:09,240



249
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:12,000
or if it will but it's exciting to know

250
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:12,000



251
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,580
that we within our lifetimes might have

252
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,580



253
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,520
a chance to be part of the solution a

254
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,520



255
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:20,520
unique generation not visiting space for

256
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,520



257
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,539
the first time but homesteading it for

258
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,539



259
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,720
the first time

260
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:24,720



261
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:29,400
here's another unresolved space law

262
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:29,400



263
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:31,770
quandary if an alien landed in your

264
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,770



265
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:36,090
backyard intelligent life from beyond

266
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,090



267
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:37,680
Earth and you shot it with a gun dressed

268
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,680



269
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:40,530
it and then cooked up you and your

270
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:40,530



271
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:47,130
family some alien meat fajitas would

272
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:47,130



273
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:50,490
that be hunting or murder we literally

274
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,490



275
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:56,430
don't know on earth we have human rights

276
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:56,430



277
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:58,220
but there are no alien rights maybe it

278
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,220



279
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:01,380
would fall under the category of

280
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,380



281
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:04,860
cultural vandalism an act that's not

282
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,860



283
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:07,710
necessarily illegal but is a giant

284
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,710



285
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,580
bummer to the rest of humanity this has

286
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,580



287
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:12,409
happened before

288
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:12,409



289
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:15,180
not with aliens but with paintings in

290
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:15,180



291
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:17,280
2003 the Chapman brothers purchased one

292
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,280



293
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:21,210
of the few remaining sets of Goya's

294
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,210



295
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:23,639
fantastic disasters of war instead of

296
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,639



297
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:26,669
displaying the works for the public they

298
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:26,669



299
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:29,690
defaced them by drawing clown and puppy

300
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:29,690



301
00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:33,570
heads on the people they called the work

302
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,570



303
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:35,280
insult to injury in protests a man threw

304
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,280



305
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:37,740
red paint on Jake Chapman when he

306
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,740



307
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,840
appeared at Modern Art Oxford but at the

308
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,840



309
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:43,560
end of the day what the Chapman brothers

310
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,560



311
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:47,039
did wasn't illegal they owned the

312
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:47,039



313
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:50,610
paintings vandalizing the moon or

314
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:50,610



315
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:54,000
killing a peaceful alien aren't illegal

316
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,000



317
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:56,880
acts but just like defacing historical

318
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,880



319
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,710
paintings they seem wrong on some deeper

320
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,710



321
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,710
level especially since because in most

322
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,710



323
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:06,000
museums you usually can't even touch the

324
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:06,000



325
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:11,190
paintings but who was the first person

326
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:11,190



327
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,979
to touch the moon with their bare hands

328
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,979



329
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:16,650
I mean the guys who walked around on the

330
00:08:13,969 --> 00:08:16,650



331
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:20,250
moon wore spacesuits they had material

332
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,250



333
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:23,430
in between their skin and the moon well

334
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,430



335
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:24,840
to be sure you already have the moon in

336
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,840



337
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:29,340
your hands

338
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:29,340



339
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:30,930
well little moons lenola the crescent

340
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,930



341
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:33,120
shaped area at the base of your

342
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,120



343
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,709
fingernail where tissue is thicker and

344
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,709



345
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,699
the red vascular structures underneath

346
00:08:34,699 --> 00:08:38,699



347
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:41,449
are more hidden making it white and to

348
00:08:38,689 --> 00:08:41,449



349
00:08:38,699 --> 00:08:44,730
be even more sure at the quantum level

350
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:44,730



351
00:08:41,449 --> 00:08:47,940
touch is problematic as I've covered

352
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,940



353
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:51,029
before atomically speaking mater never

354
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:51,029



355
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:53,880
really contacts other matter in the

356
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:53,880



357
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:55,940
conventional sense you can't truly touch

358
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,940



359
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:59,100
anything minutephysics called it

360
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:59,100



361
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:02,699
interaction over a short distance

362
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:02,699



363
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:05,550
with that in mind nASA says that Terri

364
00:09:02,689 --> 00:09:05,550



365
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:07,829
Slezak was the first person to touch the

366
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,829



367
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:09,540
moon with his bare hands he was a

368
00:09:07,819 --> 00:09:09,540



369
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:12,390
technician in quarantine who

370
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:12,390



371
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:14,430
accidentally got lunar soil smeared all

372
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,430



373
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:17,160
over his hand while removing film

374
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,160



375
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:19,980
magazines from the astronauts cameras

376
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,980



377
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:22,470
but when Armstrong and Aldrin returned

378
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,470



379
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:25,260
to the lunar module after their moonwalk

380
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,260



381
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:28,079
and removed their helmets they came into

382
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,079



383
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:30,449
contact with lunar dust they tracked in

384
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:30,449



385
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:32,699
on their suits they even reported its

386
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:32,699



387
00:09:30,449 --> 00:09:36,029
odor saying it smelled of spent

388
00:09:32,689 --> 00:09:36,029



389
00:09:32,699 --> 00:09:39,209
gunpowder or ashes possibly because it

390
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:39,209



391
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:43,770
oxidized on contact with the air in the

392
00:09:39,199 --> 00:09:43,770



393
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:46,290
cabin point is the first few breaths of

394
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,290



395
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:50,400
Moon dusty air that Armstrong and Aldrin

396
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:50,400



397
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:54,750
took in were our first fleshly contact

398
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:54,750



399
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:57,000
with the moon or were they walking

400
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,000



401
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:59,850
around on earth every day I am

402
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,850



403
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,079
surrounded by material that recently was

404
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,079



405
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,209
in outer space

406
00:10:01,069 --> 00:10:03,209



407
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:05,250
hundreds of metric tons of

408
00:10:03,199 --> 00:10:05,250



409
00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:08,520
extraterrestrial rock falls to earth

410
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,520



411
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:11,370
every year some from the moon but most

412
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:11,370



413
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:13,440
from asteroids ejected by a high-speed

414
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,440



415
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:16,140
impact and eventually caught by Earth's

00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,140



417
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,870
gravity some pieces are big enough to

418
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,870



419
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:20,790
see but most are pulverized by our

420
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,790



421
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:22,910
atmosphere during entry into tiny

422
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,910



423
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:25,520
particles that disperse in

424
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,520



425
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:27,740
the air becoming a tiny fraction of the

426
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,740



427
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:31,520
very dust and dirt we clean up and

428
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:31,520



429
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:34,520
breathe in every day there's microscopic

430
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:34,520



431
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:37,370
space dust pieces of asteroids and even

432
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,370



433
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:39,560
the moon all around us in fact there

434
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,560



435
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:43,580
might be microscopic pieces of the moon

436
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:43,580



437
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:46,490
under your bed right now or even under

438
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:46,490



439
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:49,220
your fingernails which means the first

440
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,220



441
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:51,920
human to have fleshly contact with lunar

442
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,920



443
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:54,080
material was the first Homo Sapien

444
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,080



445
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,740
hundreds of thousands of years ago to

446
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,740



447
00:10:54,080 --> 00:11:00,260
walk on dirt we are still studying

448
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,260



449
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,330
exactly how much cosmic dust is in the

450
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,330



451
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,680
air that we breathe every day but it's

452
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,680



453
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:07,280
safe to say that every once in a while

454
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:07,280



455
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:11,120
you inhale some material that was

456
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:11,120



457
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:13,060
recently in outer space some of which

458
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,060



459
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,670
thousands of years ago was on the moon

460
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:16,670



461
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:19,010
was the moon and just like other

462
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,010



463
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:21,110
particulates in our atmosphere large

464
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,110



465
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:23,960
enough pieces get trapped in the mucus

466
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,960



467
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:24,830
that protects our lungs meaning that

468
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:24,830



469
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,680
picking your nose

470
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,680



471
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:30,650
is gross but every once in a while a

472
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:30,650



473
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:35,770
booger could literally be out of this

474
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,770



475
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:35,770
world and as always thanks for watching

476
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:39,570
